// This backend is made up of 3 simple steps/parts:
// 1. Create your completion.
// 2. Once you have the completion, you begin streaming it.
// 3. Then, return the stream.

// Note: await means it doesn't hold up your code while it waits for a response.
// This means, multiple requests can be sent at the same time.
